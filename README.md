# LaMetricNextTram

App that shows when will the next train/tram come.

- The "/next-26-to-central-v1" function returns when the tram 26 that is heading to Amsterdadm Central Station will stop at the Zuiderzeeweg tram stop.
- The "/next-26-to-central" function returns when the next NS train will leave Zaandam Central Station to Amsterdam Central Station. 
>(I keept the old url name so I didn't need to publish the LametricTime app again. The app polls that hardcoded url).
